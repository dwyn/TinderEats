Testing Model Relationships

Think about a user populatng his/her form with their data

Then having access to a restaurant via dropdown menu???

The restaurant should be populated with:

	 Cuisine
	 Location
	 Contact
	 Review

1. Restaurant and Restaurant.cuisine works

2.

3. a review is written by a user assigned to a restaurant

4. pushed to the users collection of reviews
